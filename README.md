# Substack Backup

Automate backing up your Substack subscribers.

Backups will be generated using Puppeteer and saved into the `backups` folder (`config.backupFolder`, can be changed) of an S3 bucket of your choice.

**NOTE:** You need a Substack password to login with to use this tool. If you have been using the "email link" to login, just use the reset password tool to create a password. You'll still be able to use email login, but will also have a password set.

## Usage

You can get `substack-backup` up and running in just a few minutes! The best part is that **you don't need to deploy anything!**.

Just follow these steps and you'll be on your way:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Enable Actions on the repository, as they get disabled upon forking.
3. Setup an AWS S3 bucket to store your Roam backups:

- Ensure you create the AWS S3 bucket manually â€“â€“ this script will not create the bucket. Note the `awsBucketName` for step #4.
- Create (or reuse) a user in the AWS console, and ensure it has permissions to upload to an S3 bucket (the `S3FullAccess` policy will guarantee it, but you can use a more conservative policy that simply enables upload). Note the `awsAccessKeyId` and `awsAccessKeySecret` of the user for step #4.

4. In your Github repository's Settings, go to the Secrets section and add the following secrets (**naming must match exactly!**):

- `substackURL`
- `substackEmail`
- `substackPassword`
- `awsBucketName`
- `awsAccessKeyId`
- `awsAccessKeySecret`

_Don't worry! Your Substack and AWS credentials will be secure. GitHub [Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) are encrypted, and provide a convenient methodology for storing secure data in repositories._

5. Make a commit. It can be any commit, but this will start the automated backup process and trigger workflows. (You only need to do this once.)

Congrats! ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully automated the backup of your Substack subscriber list. Now go write a post about it!

_NOTE: I built this tool following @signalnerve's roam-backup as an example, and this is was his project using Puppeteer, so it may be a little buggy..._

## Development

Running this project locally should be possible using `.env` - copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in with your own authentication keys.

The project generates an `error.png` screenshot to capture the current page if something goes wrong, as well as ZIP folders, which are the JSON backups. Running `npm start` will clear any local screenshots and backups, and run the script as it would in the GitHub Actions workflow (`npm start`)
